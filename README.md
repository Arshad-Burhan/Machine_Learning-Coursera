# Machine_Learning-Coursera Projects

These are all the programming exercises that I have completed in Andrew Ng's Stanford Machine Learning course that is available in Coursera (currently in-progress):

## Linear Regression (01 linear_regression)
Fitted a linear regression model using gradient descent optimization to a dataset correlating the population of an area and profit.

## Logistic Regression (02 logistic_regression)
Built a regularized logistic regression model in order to determine whether a student gets admitted into the university.

## Neural Networks (03 neural_networks)
Created a handwriting digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset.

## Neural Networks with Backpropagation (04 neural_networks_backprop)
Implemented the backpropagation algorithm to improve the handwriting digit recognition system.

## Machine Learning System Design (05 system_design)
Explored bias-variance tradeoffs in a machine learning system by implementing a regularized linear regression model.

## Support Vector Machines (06 support_vector_machines)
Trained a support vector machine for the purpose of spam classification.

## K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (07 kmeans_pca)
Implemented K-Means for Image Compression and for learning the clusters of an example dataset using the unsupervised learning method.

## Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems (08 anomaly_recommender)
Implemented an algorithm to determine if a certain computer is anomalous. Also implemented a recommender system for movies.
